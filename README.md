# Coursera-IBM-ML-DL

This repository contains the assignments from my IBM ML & DL course on Coursera.

The course is divided into 6 sections each dedicated to an essential ML or DL topic:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing
2. Supervised Learning: Regression Models
3. Supervised Learning: Classification Models & Metrics
4. Unsupervised Learning
5. Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning
6. Specialized DL: Time Series and Survival Analysis

Each section is concluded with "take-home" assignment in which I showcase the knowledge and skills learned.
